  <p>I enjoy this prgram because it is teaching me A LOT of helpfull skills that I could show off about. My favorite thing about the classes I take on Fridays is how I get to learn about new companies. My favorite thing about art street is how kind and inspirational the teachers are. I really like this internship. The only problem would be how far it is.  </p>
